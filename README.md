# Bayesian_College_Football

This project was used as my culminating experience project to complete my MS in Applied Mathematics from the University of Colorado. I combine my interest in Bayesian statistics and College Football to create a predictive model for college football game outcomes. In the main directory is a full write-up of the work and results contained within this repository.
